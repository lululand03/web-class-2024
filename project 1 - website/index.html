        <h3>Author's positions <i>"on selling art and selling sex"</i> </h3>

    <p>Sophia Giovannitti's thoughts on art, sex, and capitalism revolve around the intricate relationships between these elements, highlighting how they intersect and influence one another in contemporary society. She critiques the commodification of both art and sex, arguing that capitalism often reduces complex human experiences and identities to mere transactions. This perspective emphasizes the ways in which women, in particular, navigate spaces where their bodies and artistic expressions are subjected to market forces.
    <br>
    Giovannitti views the art world as a microcosm of broader societal issues, where the value of art is frequently determined by its commercial viability rather than its intrinsic meaning or emotional resonance. She explores how the expectations placed on women—both as artists and as individuals—often lead to a duality in their roles, forcing them to balance personal authenticity with societal demands. By examining the commodification of femininity, she illuminates the challenges women face in asserting their agency within these frameworks, suggesting that reclaiming one's narrative is an act of resistance against the objectification inherent in both capitalism and traditional gender roles.
    <br>    
    Giovannitti's work calls for a reevaluation of the value systems that govern art and sex, advocating for a deeper understanding of the personal and political implications of selling oneself in a capitalist society. She encourages readers to consider how these dynamics shape not only individual experiences but also collective identities and movements for empowerment.</p>
